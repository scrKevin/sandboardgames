at the bottom of the totem pole
a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
in a pickle
you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
up a creek without a paddle
grass is always greener on the other side
tie the knot
get cold feet
think outside the box
why the long face?
couch potato
break a leg
on the same page
water under the bridge
bite off more than you can chew
small potatoes
skeleton in the closet
cat got your tongue
ducks in a row
spill the beans
out of this world
butterflies in your stomach
pass the buck
shoot the breeze
not the only fish in the sea
be all ears
the cat's meow
back to square one
smarty pants
set in stone
knock your socks off
my way or the highway
let the cat out of the bag
pick up the pace
hit the nail on the head
money doesn't grow on trees
like watching paint dry
wake up on the wrong side of the bed
birds of a feather flock together
over the moon
from the bottom of my heart
cut the rug
scared stiff
everybody and their dog
busy bee
a fifth wheel
give my two cents
open a can of worms
go out on a limb
in one ear and out the other
reinvent the wheel
in hot water
a wolf in sheep's clothing
out like a light
in a nutshell
too many irons in the fire
have your cake and eat it too
burn the candle at both ends
out of sight, out of mind
easy as falling off a log
close, but no cigar
just a drop in the bucket
everything but the kitchen sink
bull in a china closet
stop cold turkey
caught with your hand in the cookie jar
get the ball rolling
give him a piece of my mind
when pigs fly
teach an old dog new tricks
don't rock the boat
the bee's knees
hold down the fort
puppy love
more than you can shake a stick at
head over heels in love
eat like a bird
chip off the old block
when it rains, it pours
light at the end of the tunnel
like a deer in the headlights
better the devil you know
sweet tooth
dog and pony show
burst your bubble
pull someone's leg
the lion's share
raining cats and dogs
bouncing off the walls
in a jam
burning bridges
put it on the back burner
so hungry I could eat a horse
the way the cookie crumbles
hit the road
ballpark figure
too many cooks in the kitchen
ball is in your court
draw the shortest straw
in over your head
a little bird told me
fence-sitter
down in the dumps
push the envelope
not my cup of tea
hold your tongue
wet blanket
hold your horses
recharge your batteries
bring home the bacon
go the extra mile
keep your eye on the ball
always a bridesmaid, never a bride
money burns a hole in your pocket
cost an arm and a leg
kick the bucket
where there's smoke, there's fire
a stone's throw away
straw that broke the camel's back
get your feathers in a bunch
the cold shoulder
put your foot in your mouth
take a leaf out of his book
big fish in a small pond
one foot in the door
cry over spilt milk
as the crow flies
rub salt in an open wound
pop the question
out of the frying pan and into the fire
take it with a grain of salt
crocodile tears
steal my thunder
every cloud has a silver lining
in the same boat
out of my hair
a fly on the wall
fit as a fiddle
ants in your pants
all your eggs in one basket
in the doghouse
have two left feet
stiff upper lip
keep your chin up
bury the hatchet
cast pearls before swine
over the hill
stick out like a sore thumb
like taking candy from a baby
peanut gallery
have a cow
apple of my eye
early bird gets the worm
frog in your throat
grab the bull by the horns
bite the dust
your eyes are bigger than your stomach
while the cat's away, the mice will play
fly off the handle
at arm's length
rise above the blues
hit the sack
like shooting fish in a barrel
bring the house down
squeaky wheel gets the grease
at the end of your rope
put your foot down
fraidey cat
get your feet wet
throw a wrench in the works
carry a tune
needle in a haystack
sweep you off your feet
piece of cake
fish or cut bait
hit the books
make a mountain out of a molehill
a bolt out of the blue
good fences make good neighbors
bend over backwards
teacher's pet
cross the bridge when we come to it
chip on your shoulder
throw the towel in
make a beeline for
feeling under the weather
comparing apples and oranges
at the top of your lungs
someone with a hollow leg
barking up the wrong tree
dropping like flies
in the lap of luxury
wallflower
full of hot air
bright as a button
egg on your face
between a rock and a hard place
paint yourself into a corner
on top of the world
green thumb
you're toast
roll out the red carpet
two peas in a pod
baker's dozen
bigger fish to fry
heard it through the grapevine
one smart cookie
ruffle a few feathers
icing on the cake
best thing since sliced bread
